# Business Owner Guide: Setting Up Your Assistant

Welcome to HeyKaelo! Setting up your WhatsApp assistant takes less than 2 minutes. Follow this guide to ensure Kaelo works exactly how you need it to.

## 🏁 Step 1: Choose Your Style
When you first log in or use the `/setup` command, Kaelo will ask how you work.

- **Option 1: Fixed Time Slots**
  - Choose this if you have a physical office or shop.
  - Kaelo will prioritize your Calendar.
  
- **Option 2: Call-Out / Mobile**
  - Choose this if you spend most of your time on the road.
  - Kaelo will prioritize gathering "Job Intel" (Photos & Location).

- **Option 3: Both / Mixed (Hybrid)**
  - Choose this if you have a shop but also do deliveries or house calls.
  - Kaelo will decide which flow to use based on what the customer asks for.

## 📝 Step 2: Define Your Service
Kaelo will ask: *"What service do you provide?"*
- Be specific! Instead of "Legal", say "Divorce Attorney".
- Instead of "Beauty", say "Nail Technician & Lashes".
- **Why?** This helps Kaelo's AI sound like an expert in your field.

## 📍 Step 3: Set Your Area
- If you are **Fixed**, enter your address.
- If you are **Mobile**, enter the suburbs you cover (e.g., "Sandton, Midrand, and Fourways").

## 🤙 Step 4: Using Your Assistant on WhatsApp

Once you are set up, Kaelo handles the incoming chats. Here is how you interact with it:

### As a Business Owner:
- **Daily Summary**: Every morning, Kaelo sends you a summary of your day.
- **Approving Bookings**: If you're in Mobile mode, Kaelo will send you the customer's photo and location. Simply reply **#ok** to the chat to confirm the job.
- **Rejecting**: Reply **#no** or tell Kaelo why you can't make it.

### Your Customers see:
- A friendly, "local" assistant that knows their language (*Aweh!, Sharp!, Heita!*).
- Instant replies. No "ghosting" while you are busy on a job.
- Professional booking confirmations sent straight to their phone.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Success
1. **Sync your Calendar**: Go to the [HeyKaelo Dashboard](https://hey-kaelo-website.vercel.app/dashboard) to sync your Google Calendar. This prevents double-bookings.
2. **Be Detailed**: The more detail you give Kaelo about your "Role Type", the better it sells your service to new clients!
3. **Share your Link**: Put your unique booking link in your WhatsApp Status and Instagram Bio.
