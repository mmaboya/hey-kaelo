# HeyKaelo: New Workstyle & AI Persona Guide

We have updated HeyKaelo to be more inclusive and versatile by moving away from "Class-based" labels (Professional vs. Tradesperson) and focusing on **how you work**.

## 🚀 Key Changes

1. **Inclusive Language**: We no longer use "Professional" or "Tradesperson" in the UI. 
2. **Functional Categories**: You now choose between **Fixed Time Slots**, **Call-Out / Mobile**, or **Both / Mixed (Hybrid)**.
3. **Smart AI Personas**: Kaelo now automatically adjusts its "Brain" based on the category you choose.
4. **Pricing Refresh**: The "Professional" tier is now the **Growth Plan**, reflecting our commitment to your business expansion.

## 🛠️ The Three Workstyles

### 1. Fixed Time Slots (The Receptionist)
*Best for: Doctors, Lawyers, Therapists, Studios, or anyone with a set location.*

- **Kaelo's Goal**: Fill your calendar slots with zero friction.
- **AI Behavior**: Acts as a digital receptionist. It checks your Google/Outlook calendar and offers specific times.
- **The "Kaelo" Touch**: Once a booking is requested, Kaelo automatically sends a registration/intake form to the customer to save you admin time.
- **Workflow**: `Customer Request` -> `Check Availability` -> `Pick Slot` -> `Confirm & Send Form`.

### 2. Call-Out / Mobile (The Assistant)
*Best for: Plumbers, Electricians, Barbers, or Anyone who goes to the client.*

- **Kaelo's Goal**: Qualify leads so you don't waste time on the road.
- **AI Behavior**: Acts as a helpful field assistant. It understands that you can't just "show up" without knowing the size of the job.
- **The "Kaelo" Touch**: Kaelo will proactively ask the customer for a **Photo of the issue** and their **Location Pin (Address)**.
- **Workflow**: `Customer Request` -> `Ask for Photo/Location` -> `Notify Owner` -> `Owner Approves via Whatsapp (#ok)`.

### 3. Both / Mixed (The Hybrid)
*Best for: Beauty Salons, Tailors, or Businesses that have a shop but also travel.*

- **Kaelo's Goal**: Be the ultimate multi-tasker.
- **AI Behavior**: Versatile and adaptive.
- **The "Kaelo" Touch**: Kaelo listens to the client's intent. If they want a set time at your shop, it uses the "Receptionist" flow. If they need you to come to them, it switches to "Assistant" mode and asks for photos/location.

## 📈 Why we made this change

Businesses don't fit into neat boxes. A "Professional" might do mobile house calls, and a "Tradesperson" might have a fixed studio. By focusing on **Functional Workstyles**, we ensure:
- **No Class Bias**: We treat all entrepreneurs with the same respect.
- **Tailored Productivity**: You get the specific tools (forms vs. photos) that actually help your unique workflow.
- **Better Customer Experience**: Your clients get handled exactly how they expect for your specific service.
